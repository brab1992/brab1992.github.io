      <h2> About Me</h2>
      <p> My name is Brett Rabinovich. I am a current junior at the University of Florida. I am originally from Coral Springs, Fla. I am studying public relations and hope to obtain my degree in May 2015. I am also pursuing two minors in leadership and communication studies.Through all of my coursework I have learned valuable skills that I plan to use in the field of corporate communication. I hope to be in New York City in the future working for a major Fortune 500 corporation. Through internship experiences and involvement in extracirriculars I have been able to motivate myself in the field of public relations to continue to do what I truly love to do. In about three years I have made major strides to follow my passions and accomplish all tasks I set out to complete.</p>
      <p> The University of Florida has been the center of my entire college career, and I am extremely thankful to be given the opportunity to study at this university. Growing up I wasn't always exposed to what the college life is all about. Neither of my parents went to college, and I am the oldest sibling in my family. Coming to college has been the perfect experience for me to learn what I am most passionate about while balancing time for leisure. Gainesville has given me a unique lifestyle that has shaped me into the person I am today. I look forward to coming back to the Gator Nation each fall to adjst  </p>
