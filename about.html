      <h2> About Me</h2>
      <p> My name is Brett Rabinovich. I am a graduate from the University of Florida. I have a BS in public relations and two minors: one in leadership and the other in communication studies. Through all of my coursework and work experience I have learned valuable skills that I plan to use in my career. I am currently living in New York City since I graduated and since moving I have been able to motivate myself in the field of public relations to continue to do what I truly love to do. In four years I have made major strides to follow my passions and accomplish all tasks I set out to complete.</p>
      <p> The University of Florida has been the center of my entire college career and I am extremely thankful to be given the opportunity to study at this university. Growing up I wasn't always exposed to what college life is all about. Neither of my parents went to college and I am the oldest sibling in my family and therefore the first child to attend college. Coming to college has been the perfect experience for me to learn what I am most passionate about while balancing time for leisure. Gainesville has given me a unique lifestyle that has shaped me into the person I am today. I looked forward to my return to the Gator Nation each fall to adjust to new classes, revisit some of my favorite places after taking a summer break and enjoying all of the new improvements I see in my designated home away from home! In the spring, I focused on my heavier courseload (as always), enjoyed the colder weather in Gainesville (said weather did not prepare me for New York winters) and I always looked forward to figuring out what my plans for the summer will be filled with. The summer time was when I was able to take a break from my studies and explore my other curiosities. From visiting Australia to working at the world's most famous performing arts center in the heart of New York City, the summer is the best time for me to break away from my daily routine and explore a new place!</p>
      <p> I have always had a way with words. Since I can remember, I have always loved to immerse myself in the media. Whether it is watching the news or writing for a student publication, I love to communicate and show my efforts through publications. I strive to write to inform people of happenings in their area and also write to entertain those who want to simply know what's going on in the world around them. Involving myself in the media has always kept me motivated to accomplish larger goals that can get more people to view my work.</p>
