      <h2> About Me</h2>
      <p> My name is Brett Rabinovich. I am a current junior at the University of Florida. I am originally from Coral Springs, Fla. I am studying public relations and hope to obtain my degree in May 2015. I am also pursuing two minors in leadership and communication studies. Through all of my coursework I have learned valuable skills that I plan to use in the field of corporate communication. I hope to be in New York City in the future working for a major Fortune 500 corporation. Through internship experiences and involvement in extracurriculars I have been able to motivate myself in the field of public relations to continue to do what I truly love to do. In about three years I have made major strides to follow my passions and accomplish all tasks I set out to complete.</p>
      <p> The University of Florida has been the center of my entire college career, and I am extremely thankful to be given the opportunity to study at this university. Growing up I wasn't always exposed to what the college life is all about. Neither of my parents went to college, and I am the oldest sibling in my family and therefore the first child to attend college. Coming to college has been the perfect experience for me to learn what I am most passionate about while balancing time for leisure. Gainesville has given me a unique lifestyle that has shaped me into the person I am today. I look forward to coming back to the Gator Nation each fall to adjust to new classes, revisit some of my favorite places after taking a summer break and enjoying all of the new improvements I see in my designated home away from home! In the spring, I am used to focusing on my courses (as always), enjoying the colder weather in Gainesville and looking forward to figuring out what my summer will be filled with. The summer time is when I am able to take a break from my studies and enjoy time away from academics. From visiting Australia to finding an internship in New York City, the summer is the best time for me to break away from my daily routine and explore a new place!</p>
      <p> I have always had a way with words. Since I can remember, I have always loved to immerse myself in the media. Whether it is watching the news or writing for a student publication, I love to communicate and show my efforts through publications. I strive to write to inform people of happenings in their area, and also write to entertain those who want to simply know what's going on in the world around them. Involving myself in the media has always kept me motivated to accomplish larger goals that can get more people to view my work. In fact, you can check my <a href=images/Brett%20Rabinovich%20Web%20Resume.pdf><strong>resume</strong></a> and see exactly what projects and activities I'm up to! </p>
